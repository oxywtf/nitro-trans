     generators are used to 'bootstrap' development by creating 
     a standard directory structure and files for common tasks.
     
     app: 
        This will create some basic files to get you 
        started fleshing out your Nitro web application.

     form:
        This will create an html representation of a model.      

EXAMPLE
     gen app ~/my_application

       This will generate a new Nitro application in the 
       ~/my_application folder.

     gen form model.rb Model _model.html

       This will generate an html form of the class Model
       defined in model.rb. The html form will be output
       to _model.html
